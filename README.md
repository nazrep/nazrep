### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Frontend Developer** with above two years of professional experience in building web solutions.
My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, domain driven design, website optimization, and the Model **View View Model (MVVM)** and **Model View Controller (MVC)** methods of organizing code. So far I have **Vue, React, TypeScript, Node js**. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.

Education and career progress can be found on my linkedin profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciej-perzankowski. If you are interested in cooperation, please let me know. Send me an email: perzankowski.maciej@gmail.com.
